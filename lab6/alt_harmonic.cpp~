	Synopsis: The program prompts the user for
	a whole number that has to be greater than 
	1. If not given a number greater than 1,
	the program continously prompts the user
	for a new whole number. The program
	computes the alternating harmonic number of
	the given input, and the higher the input 
	the closer the harmonic number will be
	to ln(2), the natural logorithm of 2.
	So the program converges to ln(2) for the 
	bigger input numbers from the user.
