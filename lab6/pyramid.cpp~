	Synopsis: This program takes
	an input from the user that has to 
	be an odd integer. Then the program
	makes a pyramid from the integer by
	first outputting a row from the 
	number 1 to the inputted integer.
	Then each following row removes
	the beginning and last number from
	the previous row. Thus, the final
	row has 1 number which is the median
	between 1 and the inputted number.
