/* Synopsis: This program takes in 
   a phrase from the user and counts
   the number of occurrences of the 
   letters a, g, m, f, k, and j, which
   each have different point values, 
   thus the program finds the point total
   for each letter based on its point value
   and number of occurrences and sums the
   point values of all these letters for
   an overall point total for the phrase given.
