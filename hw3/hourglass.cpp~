  Created by: Joseph Shaffer
  Creation Date: September 27, 2016
  Synopsis: This program creates an hour glass
  shape with the symbol '*' by asking the user
  for how many of the symbol to include in the 
  top row and how many rows to create in the 
  hourglass. The program takes the user input
  and makes an hour glass by basically making
  an upside down pyramid on top of a right side
  up pyramid.
